# opfsolver
 
**SDP solver of Optimal Power Flow** aims to solve a convex relaxation for a large-scale Optimal Power Flow (OPF) Problem and then recover a near-global solution. The solver is written by [Ramtin Madani](https://loces.uta.edu), Morteza Ashraphijuo and Javad Lavaei (beta version, last updated on October 12, 2014).
