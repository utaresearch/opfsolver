# opfsolver
 
SDP solver of Optimal Power Flow aims to solve a convex relaxation for a large-scale Optimal Power Flow (OPF) Problem and then recover a near-global solution. The solver is written by Ramtin Madani, Morteza Ashraphijuo and Javad Lavaei (beta version, last updated on October 12, 2014).
